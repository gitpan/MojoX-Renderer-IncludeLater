NAME
    MojoX::Renderer::IncludeLater - A post processor to defer partial
    template rendering

DESCRIPTION
    MojoX::Renderer::IncludeLater is a Mojolicious plugin which adds support
    for deferring rendering of partial templates until the parent template
    rendering is complete.

    For example, this makes it possible to build up data during rendering
    (e.g. which input fields are rendered) and then use that data to render
    an earlier part of a template.

    This should work with any Mojolicious renderer, including
    Mojolicious::Renderer and Mojolicious::Renderer::Xslate.

SYNOPSIS
    Example 'test' template:

        % stash('my_var') // 'my_var has not been set'

    Example page template:

        <h3>Include later</h3>
        <p>Include a template immediately</p>
        % include "test" # will render 'my_var has not been set'

        <p>Include a template later</p>
        % include_later "test" # will render 'foo'

        <p>Set a value the included template expects</p>
        % stash('test' => 'foo')

    Which will generate the following output:

        <h3>Include later</h3>
        <p>Include a template immediately</p>
        my_var has not been set

        <p>Include a template later</p>
        foo

        <p>Set a value the included template expects</p>

HELPERS
    This plugin creates the following Mojolicious helpers:

  include_later
    Is identical to "include" but template inclusion happens after the rest
    of the template has been rendered.

HOOKS
    This plugin hooks into "after_render" to perform deferred template
    inclusion.
